Hello! I'm Jaden, I've spent the last 8 years figuring out how to make a game; I've participated in a couple game jams (https://ldjam.com/users/greymouth/games is host to a couple of them). I work professionally as a frontend developer, and enjoy it alot, so if you're looking for someone a frontend developer with full-stack and design experience feel free to reach out! Recently I've been working with Rust and WASM but I get easily distracted by all the cool projects people create.
